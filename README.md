# lsp_client  

Language server protocol client implementated in Nim language.  

Builtin support integrate with `nimlsp`, `nimlsp` should use my fork version [https://github.com/bung87/nimlsp](https://github.com/bung87/nimlsp)

## Development  

**Note**: `nimlsp` **should** use `release` build, as debug build write debug message to `stderror` , I may change `nimlsp` debug log to other destination in the future.
